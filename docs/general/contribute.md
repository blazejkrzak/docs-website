If you are a project that wants to build on LUKSO, or want to contribute to its development, feel free to join our [discord community](https://discord.gg/E2rJPP4) and get in touch with us!

### LIPs and LRCs

We created the [LIPs repository](https://github.com/lukso-network/LIPs), which is following the guidelines of Ethereum's [EIP repository](https://github.com/ethereum/EIPs), but is specifically for smart contract standards and improvement proposals that are relevant to the LUKSO space.

If you want to start a standard discussion, please create an issue in the LIPs repository, using the format suggest [here](https://github.com/lukso-network/LIPs/blob/master/lip-X.md). When the proposal has enough support please create a pull request against the repository, to add your `eip-xxx.md` to the `LIPs` folder.

LRC's, or LIP's should initially be in draft status, when added to the `LIPs` folder, and can later be improved using pull requests to the respective eip file.
